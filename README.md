# Turtle_anticollision

## What does the program do ?
Circles are randomly drawn on the surface so that they not collide. The coordinates of each circle are first generated randomly, these are then analyzed by the anti-collision system to ensure that they do not overlap the coordinates of a circle already drawn. 

In order to style the rendering, the circles appearing at the edge of the surface are colored in red, those appearing on an axis 0 in blue, and finally without color for the others. During the generation, information appears on the console allowing to follow the evolution of the number of drawn circles and avoided collisions. At the end of the process more detailed statistics appear.
